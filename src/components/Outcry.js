                    Project Outcry is an app made for Hong Kong protestors to
                    inform their lawyers the moment they get arrested. They only
                    need to sign up on the website with a unique alias and tell
                    that to Google Assistant at the moment of arrest. Outcry
                    will immediately send an email to the user's lawyer.
