                    Project Outcry is an app made for Hong Kong protestors to
                    inform their lawyers the moment they get arrested. Before
                    taking to the streets, they would sign up on the website and
                    create a personal profile including a unique alias. At the
                    moment of arrest simply shout the alias to Google Assistant,
                    Project Outcry will immediately send an email to notify the
                    user's lawyer of the incident.

                    Built for a 4-day Hackathon at Codaisseur, this app won the
                    second-most-favorited app by popular vote. I used
                    JavaScript, React, Redux and Google Dialogflow for this
                    project. You can learn more about the technical features by
